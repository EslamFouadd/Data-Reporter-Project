# Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Pulsar Classification. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

# Files
train.csv - the training dataset; Class is the (binary) target
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Class (whether the observation is a pulsar)
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
